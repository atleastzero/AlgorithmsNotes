# Data Structures

> A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

## Distinction between Data Structures and Abstract Data Types

Data Structures will be used to represent data. The type of data structure used to represent data will influence concrete things like time and space complexity. Abstract Data Types are more like a requirements document. They dictate what functionality a class should have without regard to implementation details. The biggest difference is that data structures concern the implementation programmer and ADTs concern the programmer using the implemented tool.

## Examples of data structures include:
 - [Arrays](DataStructures/Arrays/README.md)
 - [Linked Lists](DataStructures/LinkedLists/README.md)
 - Hash Tables
 - Tuples
 - Objects
 - Graphs
 - Binary Trees

NOTE: I'm not an expert and there's a lot of overlap between ADTs and Data Structures. Feel free to correct me via GitHub :)
